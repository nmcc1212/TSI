Apple working with TSMC isn't new; most, if not all, of the processors currently sold in Apple's products are made on one of TSMC's many manufacturing nodes.

(credit: Apple)\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that the company would definitely be buying chips made at Taiwan Semiconductor's new Arizona-based fab once it had opened. Apple working with TSMC isn't new; most, if not all, of the processors currently sold in Apple's products are made on one of TSMC's many manufacturing nodes. But being able to buy them from a US-based facility would be a first.\nThe issue, as outlined by some TSMC employees speaking to The Information in September, is that the Arizona facility would manufacture chips, but it wouldn't be building a facility to handle packaging.

As it amassed well over 100 million crypto-trading users globally, it openly told the United States government that, as an offshore operation, it didn't have to comply with the country's financial regulations and money-laundering laws.</p>\n<p>Then, late last month, those <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/sec-sues-binance-says-it-evaded-us-law-with-extensive-web-of-deception/\">years of brushing off US regulators</a> caught up with the company in the form of one of the most punitive <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/usa-binance-money-laundering-charges/\">money-laundering criminal settlements</a> in the history of the US Justice Department.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Enlarge (credit: Wired/Getty)\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne attraction of Binance, as the company grew from its 2017 founding into the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, was the firm's freewheeling flouting of rules. As it amassed well over 100 million crypto-trading users globally, it openly told the United States government that, as an offshore operation, it didn't have to comply with the country's financial regulations and money-laundering laws.\nThen, late last month, those years of brushing off US regulators caught up with the company in the form of one of the most punitive money-laundering criminal settlements in the history of the US Justice Department.

For PCs without Copilot enabled, including those that aren't signed into Microsoft accounts, the Copilot key will open Windows Search instead (though this is sort of redundant, since pressing the Windows key and then typing directly into the Start menu also activates the Search function).\nA quick Microsoft demo video shows the Copilot key in between the cluster of arrow keys and the right Alt button, a place where many keyboards usually put a menu button, a right Ctrl key, another Windows key, or something similar. The exact positioning, and the key being replaced, may vary depending on the size and layout of the keyboard.\n\nRead 5 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

The show has officially been announced for January 17, with Samsung's <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/the-next-galaxy/reserve/\">reservation website</a> promising \"Zoom with Galaxy AI is coming.\" Of course, 2023 was the year of generative AI, and Samsung's interest in the technology is a safe bet.</p>\n<p>The show will launch the Galaxy S24, which has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/galaxy-s24-leaks-show-samsungs-usual-love-for-the-iphone/\">already leaked</a> quite a bit, with the big news being a new titanium body. The iPhone made titanium the hot new thing recently with the launch of the iPhone 15, and Samsung has taken notice. The best leak so far has been from <a href=\"https://windowsreport.com/exclusive-images-galaxy-s24-lineup-gets-ai-flat-screen-new-colors-titanium-build/\">Windows Report</a>, which scored official press images of the phones.

Samsung's usual design of rounded corners and individual camera lenses complete the phone design, and while they look nice, they also look a lot like an iPhone. Older leaks claimed these two cheaper phones were getting titanium bodies, but well-known Samsung leaker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1710247896124395768\">Ice Universe</a> says only the bigger model will be titanium, and these cheaper models will be aluminum.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993482#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993482&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>",

The show has officially been announced for January 17, with Samsung's reservation website promising \"Zoom with Galaxy AI is coming.\" Of course, 2023 was the year of generative AI, and Samsung's interest in the technology is a safe bet.\nThe show will launch the Galaxy S24, which has already leaked quite a bit, with the big news being a new titanium body. The iPhone made titanium the hot new thing recently with the launch of the iPhone 15, and Samsung has taken notice. The best leak so far has been from Windows Report, which scored official press images of the phones. (The report is no longer online due to a DMCA takedown, which is a good sign of its legitimacy.)\nThe Windows Report photos showed the smaller Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus are getting flat metal sides, reminiscent of the classic iPhone 4/iPhone 15 design. Samsung's usual design of rounded corners and individual camera lenses complete the phone design, and while they look nice, they also look a lot like an iPhone. Older leaks claimed these two cheaper phones were getting titanium bodies, but well-known Samsung leaker Ice Universe says only the bigger model will be titanium, and these cheaper models will be aluminum.\n\nRead 3 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

In July 2023, the automaker cut F-150 Lightning prices heavily, but prices remained significantly higher than at launch.\n\nRead 4 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

Now we've got the first full trailer for Rebel Moon Part 2: The Scargiver, continuing the saga of our intrepid heroine Kora (Sofia Boutella) and her plucky band of allies as they take on the imperialist Motherworld.\n(Spoilers for Part 1 below.)\nAs we reported previously, years ago, director Zack Snyder had an idea for an epic Star Wars movie that he pitched to Lucasfilm. That project never panned out for a variety of reasons. But the idea continued to germinate until Netflix got on board. Apart from Star Wars, Snyder has said his influences include the films of Akira Kurosawa, especially Seven Samurai, and The Dirty Dozen. He has set his epic saga in a universe controlled by the ruthless and corrupt government of the Motherworld (the Imperium) with an army led by one Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee). The rebel moon of the title is called Veldt.\n\nRead 4 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

It had some really cool things in it.\u201d\nDuring the two years I spent putting together my book A Masterpiece in Disarray: David Lynch\u2019s Dune\u2014An Oral History, I had no luck uncovering Lynch's script for Dune II, despite Frank Herbert telling Prevue magazine in December 1984 that he possessed a copy and was advising Lynch on it. \u201cNow that we speak the same \u2018language,\u2019 it\u2019s much easier for both of us to make progress, especially with the screenplays,\u201d Herbert told the publication. Then, in July 2023, within the Frank Herbert archives at California State University, Fullerton, I came across a slim folder with a sticky note declaring \u201cDune Messiah script revisions,\u201d addressed to the second floor of VFX man Barry Nolan\u2019s office in Burbank where Lynch supervised the final effects shoots and editing on Dune.\n\nRead 44 remaining paragraphs | Comments",
