The process of certification has been one of partnership and refinement, with the MCA&#8217;s input leading to vital design modifications that, whilst introducing delays and additional costs, are essential for the vessel\u2019s safety and compliance.</p>\n<p>The result of these modifications has been a reduction in passenger capacity from the initial 1,000 to 852, a necessary concession to meet the MCA\u2019s stringent safety standards. In March 2023, it was reported that further delays have pushed the vessel&#8217;s entry into service to Autumn of 2023; in August 2023, a further delay to the first quarter of 2024 was announced.</p>\n<h3>MV Glen Rosa</h3>\n<p>The sister ship, MV Glen Rosa, shares a similar story.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "A recent drone video provides an overview of the ongoing construction of two vital ferries at the Ferguson Marine shipyard in Port Glasgow.\nThe Glen Sannox and Glen Rosa were originally due to be in service in 2018 at a total price of \u00a397m. The cost for completing the Glen Sannox has risen to \u00a3130m and for the Glen Rosa it has increased to \u00a3110m.\nI visited Port Glasgow recently to take a look at the progress of MV Glen Sannox and the MV Glen Rosa with my drone. The two ferries, previously plagued by delays, are starting to look the part now. pic.twitter.com/zR1uE3nIAh\n\u2014 George Allison (@geoallison) November 22, 2023\n\n\nBut today, we\u2019re just looking at their material state. They seem to be looking the part now, at least externally.\nMV Glen Sannox\nThe MV Glen Sannox, moored upon the Clyde, bears the semblance of readiness, with her exterior suggesting near completion. However, her outward readiness belies the extensive internal work that remains, particularly in the wake of a failed safety audit by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) in September 2023.\nThe MCA\u2019s insistence on additional staircases for safety certification precipitated a delay, pushing the sea trials of Glen Sannox to the first quarter of 2024 and casting doubt on her readiness for the forthcoming summer season.\n\nCabinet Secretary Neil Gray has articulated the MCA\u2019s integral role in the early phases of vessel delivery, particularly for those of pioneering design. The process of certification has been one of partnership and refinement, with the MCA\u2019s input leading to vital design modifications that, whilst introducing delays and additional costs, are essential for the vessel\u2019s safety and compliance.\nThe result of these modifications has been a reduction in passenger capacity from the initial 1,000 to 852, a necessary concession to meet the MCA\u2019s stringent safety standards. In March 2023, it was reported that further delays have pushed the vessel\u2019s entry into service to Autumn of 2023; in August 2023, a further delay to the first quarter of 2024 was announced.\nMV Glen Rosa\nThe sister ship, MV Glen Rosa, shares a similar story. It will also undergo design modifications following the Glen Sannox template to meet MCA standards. Her exterior, while looking close to completion with the main hull and superstructure in place, is yet to be finalised, as indicated by the extensive scaffolding that envelopes her.\nThe ferry\u2019s external aspects, from the paintwork to the installation of safety equipment, are in the midst of being completed, but her readiness for service is still some way off.\n\nInternally, there remains a substantial amount of fit-out and systems installation to be done before she can be deemed ready for operational duties. This includes the intricate fitting of dual W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 34DF diesel engines, controllable pitch propellers, and the trio of bow thrusters that will eventually enable her to reach service speeds of 14.5 knots.\n\nThe Glen Rosa, her name chosen by public vote and embroiled in what\u2019s been dubbed the \u201cferry fiasco,\u201d reflects the complexities and heightened scrutiny of modern shipbuilding.\nWith her finished tonnage at 1,273 DWT and a length of over 100 meters, she\u2019s set to be a significant vessel within the CalMac fleet, intended to carry 1,000 passengers and 127 cars or 16 HGVs, though currently licensed for 852 passengers.\n\nThe vessel\u2019s recent milestones includes the completion of design issues involving below-deck escape trunks and the announcement of a slipway launch and naming ceremony set for March 12, 2024.
