    "content": "\n<p>Hi everyone! I'm Lisha, the founder of Rosebud AI (<a href=\"https://www.rosebud.ai/\">https://www.rosebud.ai/</a>). We're building a platform to help users go from description to code to game. We aim to make game creation accessible to non-technical creators, so our UI provides explanations alongside the generated code.<p>Users have created a diverse range of games on Rosebud, including top-down RPGs, AI companions, and 3D obstacle courses, all within a few hours and sometimes minutes. Here are some examples you can play and clone (to start your own project).<p>* Anime Jester Companion: <a href=\"https://play.rosebud.ai/games/ba438cc4-246e-432e-b170-4e16948cd571\">https://play.rosebud.ai/games/ba438cc4-246e-432e-b170-4e1694...</a>\n* Chat and Care for your Digital Puppy: <a href=\"https://play.rosebud.ai/games/f32a8159-7acf-4db6-a82c-70296f90bbf1\">https://play.rosebud.ai/games/f32a8159-7acf-4db6-a82c-70296f...</a>\n* Sphere Sync (3D game: align the sphere with the right color): <a href=\"https://play.rosebud.ai/games/96dfd5e1-62d4-47d8-a3e9-11038c8bb5cf\">https://play.rosebud.ai/games/96dfd5e1-62d4-47d8-a3e9-11038c...</a>\n* Basketball: <a href=\"https://play.rosebud.ai/games/a0e70622-e923-4517-8c1f-728dcf0db486\">https://play.rosebud.ai/games/a0e70622-e923-4517-8c1f-728dcf...</a>\n* Neon Waltz Generative Art: <a href=\"https://play.rosebud.ai/games/e32bd12b-7cc9-4f9a-b385-42ae0b096466\">https://play.rosebud.ai/games/e32bd12b-7cc9-4f9a-b385-42ae0b...</a>\n* Chat with Deku from My Hero Academia: <a href=\"https://play.rosebud.ai/games/716fd998-aab6-4185-8375-85d9eeb2adca\">https://play.rosebud.ai/games/716fd998-aab6-4185-8375-85d9ee...</a><p>A simple way to think about Rosebud is ChatGPT + Midjourney + Replit. ChatGPT, because we give users a chat interface for this code editor so they can describe the game they want to make and generate game code; Midjourney, because we let users generate assets inside Rosebud, 2D and 3D, to be used in their games; And Replit, because Rosebud includes a browser based code editor that lets you deploy your game instantly.<p>Sometimes, users generate a code base from scratch via prompts. Often a simpler place to start is to modify (“clone”) an existing project on Rosebud. In both cases, we need to eventually convert user descriptions and modifications of the game into edits and changes to the codebase. To solve this problem, we had to experiment heavily with using LLM agents in production. Our agent framework tries to follow the instructions of user prompts by deciding when and whether to call upon a number of generative models (some for code generation, some for asset generation, some for character dialogue, and some for game ideas). It also must decide where to insert code snippets when it generates them. Often, a user is asking for ideas or something too vague, and our agent has to decide when to ask for feedback and clarifications.<p>Not surprisingly, if we impose more constraints, on both the programming framework and game genres supported, our agent will perform better. However, the constraints on the types of games users can make and frameworks we want to support also constrains how flexible our platform is. Balancing these two factors, we decided to only support browser-based, JavaScript frameworks and focus on supporting AI NPCs that use LLMs themselves for dialogue and actions. This allows us to create abstractions that enable the agent to alter the codebase more successfully and guide the creator towards a more successful experience. Furthermore, we found that our beta testers are very creative with making AI character based games, and the resulting game is usually fun for players.<p>How does Rosebud differ from Roblox, Unreal, or Unity simply adding a co-pilot? Incumbent game engines optimized their user-flow and tech stack before the advent of generative AI, and many of their user-flows are well established. We have the advantage of designing this game creation flow from the ground up. It's not just about adding code completion to an existing code editing app and including asset plugins.

    "contentSnippet": "Hi everyone! I'm Lisha, the founder of Rosebud AI (https://www.rosebud.ai/). We're building a platform to help users go from description to code to game. We aim to make game creation accessible to non-technical creators, so our UI provides explanations alongside the generated code.\nUsers have created a diverse range of games on Rosebud, including top-down RPGs, AI companions, and 3D obstacle courses, all within a few hours and sometimes minutes. Here are some examples you can play and clone (to start your own project).\n* Anime Jester Companion: https://play.rosebud.ai/games/ba438cc4-246e-432e-b170-4e1694...\n* Chat and Care for your Digital Puppy: https://play.rosebud.ai/games/f32a8159-7acf-4db6-a82c-70296f...\n* Sphere Sync (3D game: align the sphere with the right color): https://play.rosebud.ai/games/96dfd5e1-62d4-47d8-a3e9-11038c...\n* Basketball: https://play.rosebud.ai/games/a0e70622-e923-4517-8c1f-728dcf...\n* Neon Waltz Generative Art: https://play.rosebud.ai/games/e32bd12b-7cc9-4f9a-b385-42ae0b...\n* Chat with Deku from My Hero Academia: https://play.rosebud.ai/games/716fd998-aab6-4185-8375-85d9ee...\nA simple way to think about Rosebud is ChatGPT + Midjourney + Replit. ChatGPT, because we give users a chat interface for this code editor so they can describe the game they want to make and generate game code; Midjourney, because we let users generate assets inside Rosebud, 2D and 3D, to be used in their games; And Replit, because Rosebud includes a browser based code editor that lets you deploy your game instantly.\nSometimes, users generate a code base from scratch via prompts. Often a simpler place to start is to modify (“clone”) an existing project on Rosebud. In both cases, we need to eventually convert user descriptions and modifications of the game into edits and changes to the codebase. To solve this problem, we had to experiment heavily with using LLM agents in production. Our agent framework tries to follow the instructions of user prompts by deciding when and whether to call upon a number of generative models (some for code generation, some for asset generation, some for character dialogue, and some for game ideas). It also must decide where to insert code snippets when it generates them. Often, a user is asking for ideas or something too vague, and our agent has to decide when to ask for feedback and clarifications.\nNot surprisingly, if we impose more constraints, on both the programming framework and game genres supported, our agent will perform better. However, the constraints on the types of games users can make and frameworks we want to support also constrains how flexible our platform is. Balancing these two factors, we decided to only support browser-based, JavaScript frameworks and focus on supporting AI NPCs that use LLMs themselves for dialogue and actions. This allows us to create abstractions that enable the agent to alter the codebase more successfully and guide the creator towards a more successful experience. Furthermore, we found that our beta testers are very creative with making AI character based games, and the resulting game is usually fun for players.\nHow does Rosebud differ from Roblox, Unreal, or Unity simply adding a co-pilot? Incumbent game engines optimized their user-flow and tech stack before the advent of generative AI, and many of their user-flows are well established. We have the advantage of designing this game creation flow from the ground up. It's not just about adding code completion to an existing code editing app and including asset plugins. Such an approach wouldn't fully harness the power of LLMs. We have a chat-first interface, and having identified the limitations of agents, we can create more safeguards for users where failure is likely. Our approach will make it possible for non technical creators to also contribute to making games.\nCheck it out for yourself!\nTo try Rosebud: (1) head over to https://www.rosebud.ai/hn for access to our Discord beta tester channel and a special role.

We learned that even the best predictive systems need to be deeply understood and trusted to be useful to product teams, and set out to build the same understanding in AI.<p>To solve this, we take ideas from academia on how to benchmark the general capabilities of language models, and apply them to generating domain specific test cases that run against your actual prompts and code.<p>Consider an analogy: If you’re a lawyer, we don’t need to be lawyers to open up a legal textbook and test your knowledge of the content. Similarly if you’re building a legal AI application, we don’t need to build your application to come up with an effective set of tests that can benchmark your performance.<p>To make this more concrete - when you pick a topic in the demo, we grab the associated wikipedia page and extract a bunch of facts from it using a classic NLP technique called “named entity recognition”. For example if you picked FreeBASIC, we might extract the following line from it:<p><pre><code>    Source of truth: \"IDEs specifically made for FreeBASIC include FBide and FbEdit,[5] while more graphical options include WinFBE Suite and VisualFBEditor.\" \n\n</code></pre>\nThis line is our source of truth. We then use an LLM to work backwards from this fact into a question and answer:<p><pre><code>    Question: \"What programming language are the IDEs WinFBE Suite and FbEdit designed to support?\"\n    Reference Answer: \"FreeBasic\"\n\n</code></pre>\nWe can then evaluate accurately by comparing the reference answer and the original source of truth– this is how we generate “simple” questions in the demo.<p>In production we’re building this same functionality on our customers' knowledge base instead of wikipedia. We then employ a few different strategies to generate questions – these range from simple factual questions like “how much does the 2024 chevy tahoe cost”, to complex questions like “What would a mechanic have to do to fix the recall on my 2018 Golf?” These questions are based on facts extracted from your knowledge base and real customer examples.<p>This testing and grading process is fast – it’s driven by a mixture of LLMs and traditional algorithms, and can turn around in minutes. Our business model is pretty simple - we charge for each test created.
