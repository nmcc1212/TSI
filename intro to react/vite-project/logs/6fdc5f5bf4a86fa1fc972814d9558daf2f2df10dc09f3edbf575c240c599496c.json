Some say they've never used the desktop app.\nDrive has multiple ways of syncing files, which complicates any explanation or diagnosis of what's going on. The most suspect mode in the whole fiasco is the default \"file streaming,\" mode which is actually cloud-first. Files get removed from your computer and stored in the cloud, saving space and leaving only a web link in their place. Perhaps a \"syncing\" issue could remove files from your computer before uploading (that still doesn't explain the claims of missing web documents, though).\n\nRead 6 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

Apple is reportedly preparing to launch updates to the MacBook Air, as well as several new iPad models, in \"the March time frame.\" Apple hasn't released any new iPads in 2023, and the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air was introduced in July of 2022.\nGurman says not to expect design changes from the M3 Air. The M2 version introduced a new non-tapered design with a display notch, a new keyboard, and a MagSafe port, and the M3 Air should look externally identical.\n\nRead 4 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

In this week's report, we have some news on some major rocket debuts planned for 2024, namely United Launch Alliance's Vulcan (now set for January) and Blue Origin's long-awaited New Glenn.\nAs always, we welcome reader submissions, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.\n\nLost tanks will delay final Vega launch. Remember last week's report that Avio, the Italian rocket-maker, lost track of propellant tanks needed for the final launch of Europe's Vega rocket? Well, it looks like Avio and the European Space Agency have a plan to remedy the situation, but it's risky and will delay the Vega launch by several months, Space News reports. “Avio has confirmed to ESA that there is an issue with tanks for the last Vega flight,” said Toni Tolker-Nielsen, ESA director of space transportation, without addressing the earlier report that the tanks for Vega's upper stage were found in a landfill, crushed and unusable.\n\nRead 24 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

It's been almost four years since third-party cookies have been disabled in Firefox and Safari, but Google, one of the world's largest ad companies, has been slow-rolling the death of the tracking cookie. Ad companies use third-party cookies to track users across the web, and that web activity is used to show users relevant ads. Now that Google's alternative user-tracking ad system, the \"Privacy Sandbox,\" has launched in Chrome, it's finally ready to do away with the previous form of ad tracking. The new timeline to kill third-party cookies is the second half of 2024.\nGoogle's blog post calls the rollout \"Tracking Protection\" and says the first tests will begin on January 4, where 1 percent of Chrome users will get the feature.

Usually, when a company gets spun out of Google it becomes an Alphabet company, but that's not the case here. Google is transferring assets to a new independent company, of which Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners (SIP) is an investor, and Alphabet is an investor in SIP.</p>\n\n<p>The first existing service getting pulled into Renew Home is <a href=\"https://nestrenew.google.com/welcome/\">Nest Renew</a>. This service for Nest Thermostats uses power company data to tell consumers how their electricity is being generated and what it costs. That data lets your thermostat do things like automatically shift heating and cooling to times of day when energy is cheaper or cleaner, and shows various reports about the cleanness of the energy you've been using. (Nest's feature that lets utility companies remotely <em>take control</em> of your thermostat, Rush Hour Rewards, does not seem to be part of Renew Home.)</p>\n<p>Another service being pulled into Renew Home is the SIP-owned OhmConnect, which is the same basic idea as Nest's grid data-power thermostat adjustments but for more than just your thermostat.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Enlarge (credit: Alphabet)\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle's Nest Renue energy tracking feature is being spun off into a new company called \"Renew Home.\" The core concept is partnering with power companies to obtain data about the current condition of the power grid and using that data to change consumer habits. Usually, when a company gets spun out of Google it becomes an Alphabet company, but that's not the case here. Google is transferring assets to a new independent company, of which Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners (SIP) is an investor, and Alphabet is an investor in SIP.\nThe first existing service getting pulled into Renew Home is Nest Renew. This service for Nest Thermostats uses power company data to tell consumers how their electricity is being generated and what it costs. That data lets your thermostat do things like automatically shift heating and cooling to times of day when energy is cheaper or cleaner, and shows various reports about the cleanness of the energy you've been using. (Nest's feature that lets utility companies remotely take control of your thermostat, Rush Hour Rewards, does not seem to be part of Renew Home.)\nAnother service being pulled into Renew Home is the SIP-owned OhmConnect, which is the same basic idea as Nest's grid data-power thermostat adjustments but for more than just your thermostat. OhmConnect is compatible with a very small list of smart devices, like Nest-rival Ecobee and Honeywell thermostats, TP-Link's \"Kasa\" smart home system, and Tesla vehicles. The backbone of the service appears to be the in-house \"OhmPlug\" smart outlet, which can monitor the energy usage of anything that plugs into the wall.

Once they're in, attackers compromise the integrity of SSH sessions that form the lynchpin for admins to securely connect to computers inside the cloud and other sensitive environments.</p>\n<p>Terrapin, as the vulnerability has been named, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/12/hackers-can-break-ssh-channel-integrity-using-novel-data-corruption-attack/\">came to light</a> two weeks ago in a research paper published by academic researchers. Tracked as CVE-2023-48795, the attack the researchers devised works when attackers have an adversary-in-the-middle attack (also abbreviated as AitM and known as man-in-the-middle or MitM), such as when they’re positioned on the same local network and can secretly intercept communications and assume the identity of both the recipient and the sender.</p>\n<p>In those instances, Terrapin allows attackers to alter or corrupt information transmitted in the SSH data stream during the handshake—the earliest connection stage, when the two parties negotiate the encryption parameters they will use to establish a secure connection.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Enlarge (credit: Getty Images)\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoughly 11 million Internet-exposed servers remain susceptible to a recently discovered vulnerability that allows attackers with a foothold inside affected networks. Once they're in, attackers compromise the integrity of SSH sessions that form the lynchpin for admins to securely connect to computers inside the cloud and other sensitive environments.\nTerrapin, as the vulnerability has been named, came to light two weeks ago in a research paper published by academic researchers. Tracked as CVE-2023-48795, the attack the researchers devised works when attackers have an adversary-in-the-middle attack (also abbreviated as AitM and known as man-in-the-middle or MitM), such as when they’re positioned on the same local network and can secretly intercept communications and assume the identity of both the recipient and the sender.\nIn those instances, Terrapin allows attackers to alter or corrupt information transmitted in the SSH data stream during the handshake—the earliest connection stage, when the two parties negotiate the encryption parameters they will use to establish a secure connection. As such, Terrapin represents the first practical cryptographic attack targeting the integrity of the SSH protocol itself. It works by targeting BPP (Binary Packet Protocol), which is designed to ensure AitMs can’t add or drop messages exchanged during the handshake. This prefix truncation attack works when implementations support either the \"ChaCha20-Poly1305\" or \"CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC,\" cipher modes, which, at the time the paper was published, was found in 77 percent of SSH servers.\n\nRead 8 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

It's January 5, and today's photo reveals the Crab Nebula in all of its glory.\nThis object, known more formally as Messier 1 or M1, earned its colloquial name when Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons observed and drew this object in the early 1840s. It looked something like a crab with arms, and the appellation stuck. The nebula had been discovered about a century earlier by English astronomer John Bevis.\n\nRead 4 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

(credit: Qualcomm)\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Apple Vision Pro is coming out sometime in early 2024, and since it is a VR/AR headset that runs iOS apps, Team Android would like to have a competitor available. Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm vaguely announced a mixed-reality partnership a year ago, which would have Qualcomm building chips, Google building software, and Samsung shipping products. Step 1 of this partnership has been announced: The Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2+ SoC, which will power many of these headsets from Samsung and others.\nPerhaps more interesting than the individual specs of Qualcomm's chip is all the partner talk surrounding the launch. Samsung says it's \"thrilled to collaborate with Qualcomm Technologies and Google in revolutionizing the mobile industry once more\" and promises a \"best-in-class XR experience for Galaxy users.\" Google is promising an \"immersive and spatial XR\" experience based on Android. Qualcomm is making a reference headset design based on the chip and says at least five companies have hardware in development, including Samsung, Google, HTC, Immersed, and Play for Dream.\n\nA few specs for the XR2+ Gen 2 (credit: Qualcomm)\n\nThe XR2+ Gen 2 is an upgrade over the XR2 Gen 2 (non-plus) that came out in 2023 and shipped in the Meta Quest 3. The most significant difference is a bump in resolution, with the plus model supporting \"4.3K\" resolution per eye at 90 fps. The old chip only did 3K by 3K. The resolution of these headsets is critical, not just because games will look nicer, but if you're trying to display a virtual desktop and read text, you're pushing the resolution limits of current headsets.\n\nRead 2 remaining paragraphs | Comments",
