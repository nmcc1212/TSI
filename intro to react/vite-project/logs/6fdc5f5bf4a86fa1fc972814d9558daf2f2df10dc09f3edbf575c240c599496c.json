Now, over nine years <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/05/mario-kart-8-review-one-step-forward-one-step-back/\">since the game's initial release</a>, Nintendo has taken steps to eliminate the controversial \"bagging\" strategy in the latest update to the Switch's <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Mario Kart 8</em> players who made use of \"bagging\" (short for \"sandbagging\" and sometimes also called \"item smuggling\") in online races would briefly retreat to last place to sit on a regenerating item box, waiting to acquire some of the game's most powerful items (which are <a href=\"https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Kart_8_item_probability_distributions\">much more likely to appear when you are far away from first place</a>). The bagging player could then use one of those items (say, a Golden Mushroom and/or Starman) to quickly catch up with the pack before using the other amassed item (say, a Bullet Bill) to build up a dominant lead. The strategy can be especially effective on tracks like \"Cheese Land,\" where using a Bullet Bill in very specific locations <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmHoBDharl0\">can extend how long the powerful item lasts</a>.</p>\n<h2>Not “cheating,” but not exactly “racing”?</h2>\n<p>Despite bagging's controversial reputation among many players, the strategy isn't really comparable to outright cheating—baggers play an unmodified version of the game as it was designed, after all.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Baby Luigi represents the reaction of sandbagging racers in this artistic rendering. (credit: Nintendo)\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince Mario Kart 8's launch on the Wii U, one of the game's most successful and controversial strategies has involved intentionally hanging out at the back of the pack to amass and abuse the game's best items. Now, over nine years since the game's initial release, Nintendo has taken steps to eliminate the controversial \"bagging\" strategy in the latest update to the Switch's Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.\nMario Kart 8 players who made use of \"bagging\" (short for \"sandbagging\" and sometimes also called \"item smuggling\") in online races would briefly retreat to last place to sit on a regenerating item box, waiting to acquire some of the game's most powerful items (which are much more likely to appear when you are far away from first place). The bagging player could then use one of those items (say, a Golden Mushroom and/or Starman) to quickly catch up with the pack before using the other amassed item (say, a Bullet Bill) to build up a dominant lead.

But being able to buy them from a US-based facility would be a first.\nThe issue, as outlined by some TSMC employees speaking to The Information in September, is that the Arizona facility would manufacture chips, but it wouldn't be building a facility to handle packaging. And without packaging, the Arizona factory would essentially be a \"paperweight,\" requiring any chips made there to be shipped to Taiwan for assembly before they could be put in any products.\nToday Apple announced that it had solved that particular problem, partnering with a company called Amkor to handle chip packaging in Arizona. Amkor says that it will invest $2 billion to build the facility, which will \"employ approximately 2,000 people\" and \"is targeted to be ready for production within the next two to three years.\" Apple says that it has already worked with Amkor on chip packaging for \"more than a decade.\"\n\nRead 5 remaining paragraphs | Comments",
