In the most popular issue thread on the Google Drive Community forums, several users describe spreadsheets and documents going missing, which all would have been created and saved in the web interface, not the desktop app, and it's hard to see how the desktop app could affect that. Many users peg \"May 2023\" as the time documents stopped saving. Some say they've never used the desktop app.\nDrive has multiple ways of syncing files, which complicates any explanation or diagnosis of what's going on. The most suspect mode in the whole fiasco is the default \"file streaming,\" mode which is actually cloud-first. Files get removed from your computer and stored in the cloud, saving space and leaving only a web link in their place. Perhaps a \"syncing\" issue could remove files from your computer before uploading (that still doesn't explain the claims of missing web documents, though).\n\nRead 6 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

(credit: Andrew Cunningham)\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MacBook Air is Apple's most popular laptop, and when the Apple M1 and M2 chips landed, they came to the Air first. That changed with the M3 chip generation, which came to the MacBook Pro and iMac first but left the Air untouched.\nThat situation should change early next year, according to a report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Apple is reportedly preparing to launch updates to the MacBook Air, as well as several new iPad models, in \"the March time frame.\" Apple hasn't released any new iPads in 2023, and the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air was introduced in July of 2022.\nGurman says not to expect design changes from the M3 Air. The M2 version introduced a new non-tapered design with a display notch, a new keyboard, and a MagSafe port, and the M3 Air should look externally identical.\n\nRead 4 remaining paragraphs | Comments",
