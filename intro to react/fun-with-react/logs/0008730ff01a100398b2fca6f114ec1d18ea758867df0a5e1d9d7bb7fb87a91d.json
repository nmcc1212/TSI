    "content": "A new study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine finds that about 22 minutes a day of moderate to vigorous activity may combat the negative effects of prolonged sitting. Furthermore, they researchers found that as a person's activity level increases, the risk of dying prematurely from any cause goes down. NBC News reports: In the study, researchers looked at information from nearly 12,000 people ages 50 and older in four datasets from Norway, Sweden and the United States. In those datasets, the participants wore movement detection devices on their hips for 10 hours a day for at least four days. All of the individuals included in the new study were tracked for at least two years. In the new analysis, the researchers accounted for factors, including medical conditions, that could've affected risk of early death. About half of the participants spent 10 1/2 hours or more sedentary each day.\n \nWhen the researchers linked the participants' information with death registries in the different countries, they found that over an average of five years, 805 people, or 17%, had died. Of those who died, 357, or 6%, had spent less than 10 1/2 hours a day seated, while 448 averaged 10 1/2 hours or more sedentary. Sitting for more than 12 hours a day, the researchers found, was associated with a 38% increased risk of death as compared to eight hours, but only among those who managed to get less than 22 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity a day.\n \nThe risk of death went down with increasing amounts of physical activity. An extra 10 minutes a day translated into a 15% lower risk of death among those spending fewer than 10 1/2 hours seated and a 35% lower risk among those who spent more than 10 1/2 hours sedentary each day. Lower intensity activity only made a difference among participants who spent 12 or more hours sitting every day. The study's lead author, Edvard Sagelv, a researcher at The Arctic University of Norway, broke the findings down into manageable terms. \"Think of it: only 20 minutes of this a day is enough, meaning, a small stroll of 10 minutes twice a day -- like jumping off the bus one stop before your actual destination to work and then when taking the bus back home, jumping off one stop before.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Around+20+Minutes+of+Exercise+a+Day+May+Balance+Out+the+Harms+of+Sitting%2C+Study+Finds%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F23%2F10%2F27%2F0024211%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F23%2F10%2F27%2F0024211%2Faround-20-minutes-of-exercise-a-day-may-balance-out-the-harms-of-sitting-study-finds%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://science.slashdot.org/story/23/10/27/0024211/around-20-minutes-of-exercise-a-day-may-balance-out-the-harms-of-sitting-study-finds?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23109607&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

    "content": "Dan Goodin reports via Ars Technica: Three years ago, Apple introduced a privacy-enhancing feature that hid the Wi-Fi address of iPhones and iPads when they joined a network. On Wednesday, the world learned that the feature has never worked as advertised. Despite promises that this never-changing address would be hidden and replaced with a private one that was unique to each SSID, Apple devices have continued to display the real one, which in turn got broadcast to every other connected device on the network. [...]\n \nIn 2020, Apple released iOS 14 with a feature that, by default, hid Wi-Fi MACs when devices connected to a network. Instead, the device displayed what Apple called a \"private Wi-Fi address\" that was different for each SSID. Over time, Apple has enhanced the feature, for instance, by allowing users to assign a new private Wi-Fi address for a given SSID. On Wednesday, Apple released iOS 17.1. Among the various fixes was a patch for a vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-42846, which prevented the privacy feature from working. Tommy Mysk, one of the two security researchers Apple credited with discovering and reporting the vulnerability (Talal Haj Bakry was the other), told Ars that he tested all recent iOS releases and found the flaw dates back to version 14, released in September 2020. \"From the get-go, this feature was useless because of this bug,\" he said. \"We couldn't stop the devices from sending these discovery requests, even with a VPN.

    "contentSnippet": "Dan Goodin reports via Ars Technica: Three years ago, Apple introduced a privacy-enhancing feature that hid the Wi-Fi address of iPhones and iPads when they joined a network. On Wednesday, the world learned that the feature has never worked as advertised. Despite promises that this never-changing address would be hidden and replaced with a private one that was unique to each SSID, Apple devices have continued to display the real one, which in turn got broadcast to every other connected device on the network. [...]\n \nIn 2020, Apple released iOS 14 with a feature that, by default, hid Wi-Fi MACs when devices connected to a network. Instead, the device displayed what Apple called a \"private Wi-Fi address\" that was different for each SSID. Over time, Apple has enhanced the feature, for instance, by allowing users to assign a new private Wi-Fi address for a given SSID. On Wednesday, Apple released iOS 17.1. Among the various fixes was a patch for a vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-42846, which prevented the privacy feature from working. Tommy Mysk, one of the two security researchers Apple credited with discovering and reporting the vulnerability (Talal Haj Bakry was the other), told Ars that he tested all recent iOS releases and found the flaw dates back to version 14, released in September 2020. \"From the get-go, this feature was useless because of this bug,\" he said. \"We couldn't stop the devices from sending these discovery requests, even with a VPN. Even in the Lockdown Mode.\"\n \nWhen an iPhone or any other device joins a network, it triggers a multicast message that is sent to all other devices on the network.

That's another SEO move; some experts say active profiles can improve a business's rankings.

Dubbed the Fourth Amendment is Not For Sale, the legislation passed 219-199. It requires law enforcement and other government entities to get a warrant before buying information from third-party data brokers who purchase information gleaned from apps.

The video starts with Atlas lying in a cadaver-like fashion on the floor before it swiftly folds its legs backward over its body and rises to a standing position in a manner befitting some kind of Cronenberg body-horror flick. Its curved, illuminated head does add some Pixar lamp-like charm, but the way Atlas then spins at the waist and marches toward the camera really feels rather jarring. The design itself is also a little more humanoid. Similar to bipedal robots like Tesla's Optimus, the new Atlas now has longer limbs, a straighter back, and a distinct \"head\" that can swivel around as needed. There are no cables in sight, and its \"face\" includes a built-in ring light.

Appointed as head of AI safety is Paul Christiano, a former OpenAI researcher who pioneered a foundational AI safety technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), but is also known for predicting that \"there's a 50 percent chance AI development could end in 'doom.'\" While Christiano's research background is impressive, some fear that by appointing a so-called \"AI doomer,\" NIST may be risking encouraging non-scientific thinking that many critics view as sheer speculation.\n \nThere have been rumors that NIST staffers oppose the hiring. A controversial VentureBeat report last month cited two anonymous sources claiming that, seemingly because of Christiano's so-called \"AI doomer\" views, NIST staffers were \"revolting.\" Some staff members and scientists allegedly threatened to resign, VentureBeat reported, fearing \"that Christiano's association\" with effective altruism and \"longtermism could compromise the institute's objectivity and integrity.\" NIST's mission is rooted in advancing science by working to \"promote US innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.\" Effective altruists believe in \"using evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible\" and longtermists that \"we should be doing much more to protect future generations,\" both of which are more subjective and opinion-based. On the Bankless podcast, Christiano shared his opinions last year that \"there's something like a 10-20 percent chance of AI takeover\" that results in humans dying, and \"overall, maybe you're getting more up to a 50-50 chance of doom shortly after you have AI systems that are human level.\" \"The most likely way we die involves -- not AI comes out of the blue and kills everyone -- but involves we have deployed a lot of AI everywhere... [And] if for some reason, God forbid, all these AI systems were trying to kill us, they would definitely kill us,\" Christiano said.\n \nAs head of AI safety, Christiano will seemingly have to monitor for current and potential risks. He will \"design and conduct tests of frontier AI models, focusing on model evaluations for capabilities of national security concern,\" steer processes for evaluations, and implement \"risk mitigations to enhance frontier model safety and security,\" the Department of Commerce's press release said. Christiano has experience mitigating AI risks. He left OpenAI to found the Alignment Research Center (ARC), which the Commerce Department described as \"a nonprofit research organization that seeks to align future machine learning systems with human interests by furthering theoretical research.\" Part of ARC's mission is to test if AI systems are evolving to manipulate or deceive humans, ARC's website said. ARC also conducts research to help AI systems scale \"gracefully.\" \"In addition to Christiano, the safety institute's leadership team will include Mara Quintero Campbell, a Commerce Department official who led projects on COVID response and CHIPS Act implementation, as acting chief operating officer and chief of staff,\" reports Ars. \"Adam Russell, an expert focused on human-AI teaming, forecasting, and collective intelligence, will serve as chief vision officer.

    "content": "AltStore PAL has become one of the first alternative app marketplaces to launch in the European Union. Developed by Riley Testut, AltStore PAL is marketed as an open-source project designed to distribute apps from independent developers. MacRumors reports: At launch, it features two apps, including Testut's Delta game emulator and clipboard manager app Clip. Delta is also being simultaneously released in the App Store outside of the European Union, but it looks like EU customers will need to download it from AltStore. Testut says that once AltStore PAL is \"running smoothly,\" third-party app developers will be able to submit their apps for distribution outside of the App Store. The app marketplace is designed to be decentralized with no directory, so developers will need to self-promote their apps and direct users to their websites to install an app through AltStore.\n \nDistributing apps through AltStore is free of charge, but it is worth noting that apps that see more than one million first annual installs will need to pay Apple an 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee. App marketplaces have to pay the fee for every install with no free allowance, so AltStore is charged 0.50 euros each time it is installed. To afford the fee, Testut is charging 1.50 euros per year for AltStore PAL access. Testut has been working on AltStore PAL since Apple announced plans to support alternative app marketplaces in iOS 17.4. It is open to all apps, but Testut says that it makes the most sense for \"smaller, indie apps that otherwise couldn't exist due to App Store rules.\" AltStore PAL is equipped with Patreon integration to allow developers to monetize their apps. Developers can offer their apps to just their patrons, and this method of distribution also allows for a sub-1 million cap on those who can subscribe to use an app.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=AltStore+PAL+Alternative+App+Marketplace+Launches+On+iPhone+In+EU%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fapple.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F04%2F17%2F2041240%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fapple.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F04%2F17%2F2041240%2Faltstore-pal-alternative-app-marketplace-launches-on-iphone-in-eu%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://apple.slashdot.org/story/24/04/17/2041240/altstore-pal-alternative-app-marketplace-launches-on-iphone-in-eu?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23294320&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

[...] In the UAE, a record 254 millimetres (10 inches) of rainfall was recorded in Al Ain, a city bordering Oman. It was the largest ever in a 24-hour period since records started in 1949. Rainfall is rare in the UAE and elsewhere on the Arabian Peninsula, that is typically known for its dry desert climate. Summer air temperatures can soar above 50 degrees Celsius. But the UAE and Oman also lack drainage systems to cope with heavy rains and submerged roads are not uncommon during rainfall. \n\nFollowing Tuesday's events, questions were raised whether cloud seeding, a process that the UAE frequently conducts, could have caused the heavy rains. Cloud seeding is a process in which chemicals are implanted into clouds to increase rainfall in an environment where water scarcity is a concern. The UAE, located in one of the hottest and driest regions on earth, has been leading the effort to seed clouds and increase precipitation. But the UAE's meteorology agency told Reuters there were no such operations before the storm. The huge rainfall was instead likely due to a normal weather system that was exacerbated by climate change, experts say. A low pressure system in the upper atmosphere, coupled with low pressure at the surface had acted like a pressure 'squeeze' on the air, according to Esraa Alnaqbi, a senior forecaster at the UAE government's National Centre of Meteorology.

From the report: For nearly a decade, workers in a warehouse in Seattle's Denny Triangle neighborhood have shipped boxes of shoes, beach chairs, Marvel T-shirts and other items to online retail customers across the U.S. The operation, called Big River Services International, sells around $1 million a year of goods through e-commerce marketplaces including eBay, Shopify, Walmart and Amazon under brand names such as Rapid Cascade and Svea Bliss. \"We are entrepreneurs, thinkers, marketers and creators,\" Big River says on its website. \"We have a passion for customers and aren't afraid to experiment.\" \n\nWhat the website doesn't say is that Big River is an arm of Amazon that surreptitiously gathers intelligence on the tech giant's competitors. Born out of a 2015 plan code named \"Project Curiosity,\" Big River uses its sales across multiple countries to obtain pricing data, logistics information and other details about rival e-commerce marketplaces, logistics operations and payments services, according to people familiar with Big River and corporate documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal. The team then shared that information with Amazon to incorporate into decisions about its own business. \n\n[...] The story of Big River offers new insight into Amazon's elaborate efforts to stay ahead of rivals. Team members attended their rivals' seller conferences and met with competitors identifying themselves only as employees of Big River Services, instead of disclosing that they worked for Amazon. They were given non-Amazon email addresses to use externally -- in emails with people at Amazon, they used Amazon email addresses -- and took other extraordinary measures to keep the project secret. They disseminated their reports to Amazon executives using printed, numbered copies rather than email. Those who worked on the project weren't even supposed to discuss the relationship internally with most teams at Amazon.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Inside+Amazon's+Secret+Operation+To+Gather+Intel+on+Rivals%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F04%2F18%2F0636230%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F04%2F18%2F0636230%2Finside-amazons-secret-operation-to-gather-intel-on-rivals%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://slashdot.org/story/24/04/18/0636230/inside-amazons-secret-operation-to-gather-intel-on-rivals?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23294830&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",
