But the reality is that we still have a great deal more to learn.</p>\n<p>Even our seemingly familiar shallow seafloors near the coast are relatively poorly mapped. Many people may think such areas are well explored, but there are still fundamental questions we can’t answer because detailed surveys haven’t been done.</p>\n<p>The UK’s surrounding seas hold a vast underwater graveyard. Thousands of shipwrecks, from centuries of trade and conflict, litter the seabed like silent historical markers.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, even though we know where many wrecks lie, their true identities often remain a mystery. But the <a href=\"https://unpathdwaters.org.uk\">Unpath’d Waters</a> project is now linking maritime archives with existing scientific data to help reveal some of these secrets.</p>\n<h2>History meets science</h2>\n<p>Scientists are using detailed sonar surveys from more than 100 shipwrecks west of the Isle of Man. Combining this underwater data with historical documents from around the world, researchers are piecing together a massive nautical jigsaw puzzle, finally revealing the true stories of these sunken vessels.</p>\n<p>The first successful identification to be made as part of this work is that of the SS Hartdale. When the 105 metre long vessel was torpedoed at dawn on March 13 1915 by the <a href=\"https://uboat.net/wwi/boats/?boat=27\">German submarine U-27</a>, two of its crew were lost and its final location remained unknown.</p>\n<p>Researchers began by scanning known wrecks in the attack area, narrowing the possibilities down to less than a dozen. Then, they compared wreck details with official records and diver observations, eliminating candidates one by one until the SS Hartdale emerged as the perfect match. The vessel is lying at a depth of 80 metres, 12 miles off the coast of Northern Ireland.</p>\n<figure class=\"align-center \"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/582797/original/file-20240319-18-d8akp2.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/582797/original/file-20240319-18-d8akp2.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=269&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/582797/original/file-20240319-18-d8akp2.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=269&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/582797/original/file-20240319-18-d8akp2.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=269&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/582797/original/file-20240319-18-d8akp2.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=339&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/582797/original/file-20240319-18-d8akp2.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=339&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/582797/original/file-20240319-18-d8akp2.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=339&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" alt=\"An old longitudinal section drawing of a ship.\" /><figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The original plans for the SS Hartdale from 1910, originally named Benbrook.</span><br />\n<span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://hec.lrfoundation.org.uk/archive-library/documents/lrf-pun-w864-0026-p\">The Lloyd’s Register Foundation</a></span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Important details about SS Hartdale are available online via the <a href=\"https://hec.lrfoundation.org.uk/archive-library/ships/benbrook-1910-hartdale/search/everywhere:benbrook/page/1\">Lloyds Register Foundation</a>. This includes plans for the construction of the ship, formerly known as Benbrook, built for Joseph Hault &amp; Co. Ltd in 1910. This information, together with eye-witness accounts reported in the national press at the time, have proved to be crucial in confirming the wreck’s identity.</p>\n<p>The US historian Michael Lowrey also provided the project team with a translated copy of notes extracted from an official German account and scans of U-27’s official war diary made by its commanding officer, <a href=\"https://uboat.net/wwi/men/commanders/391.html\">Kapitänleutnant Bernd Wegener</a>.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "How we discovered the wreck of a torpedoed British ship after a 109-year mystery.\nA British cargo ship which was torpedoed and sunk during the first world war has finally surrendered its 109-year-old secret.\nThe SS Hartdale was steaming from Glasgow to Alexandria in Egypt with its cargo of coal when it was targeted by a German U-boat in March 1915. The location of the ship had long been a mystery, but my colleagues and I have, at last, pinpointed its final resting place.\nThis article is the opinion of the author Michael Roberts, Bangor University and not necessarily that of the UK Defence Journal. If you would like to submit your own article on this topic or any other, please see our submission guidelines.\nThe SS Hartdale is lying at a depth of 80 metres, 12 miles off the coast of Northern Ireland. Michael Roberts/Unpath’d Waters, Author provided.\nThe old adage that we know more about the surface of the Moon and about Mars than we do about Earth’s deep sea may no longer hold entirely true. But the reality is that we still have a great deal more to learn.\nEven our seemingly familiar shallow seafloors near the coast are relatively poorly mapped. Many people may think such areas are well explored, but there are still fundamental questions we can’t answer because detailed surveys haven’t been done.\nThe UK’s surrounding seas hold a vast underwater graveyard. Thousands of shipwrecks, from centuries of trade and conflict, litter the seabed like silent historical markers.\nSurprisingly, even though we know where many wrecks lie, their true identities often remain a mystery. But the Unpath’d Waters project is now linking maritime archives with existing scientific data to help reveal some of these secrets.\nHistory meets science\nScientists are using detailed sonar surveys from more than 100 shipwrecks west of the Isle of Man. Combining this underwater data with historical documents from around the world, researchers are piecing together a massive nautical jigsaw puzzle, finally revealing the true stories of these sunken vessels.\nThe first successful identification to be made as part of this work is that of the SS Hartdale. When the 105 metre long vessel was torpedoed at dawn on March 13 1915 by the German submarine U-27, two of its crew were lost and its final location remained unknown.\nResearchers began by scanning known wrecks in the attack area, narrowing the possibilities down to less than a dozen. Then, they compared wreck details with official records and diver observations, eliminating candidates one by one until the SS Hartdale emerged as the perfect match. The vessel is lying at a depth of 80 metres, 12 miles off the coast of Northern Ireland.\nThe original plans for the SS Hartdale from 1910, originally named Benbrook.\nThe Lloyd’s Register Foundation\nImportant details about SS Hartdale are available online via the Lloyds Register Foundation. This includes plans for the construction of the ship, formerly known as Benbrook, built for Joseph Hault & Co. Ltd in 1910. This information, together with eye-witness accounts reported in the national press at the time, have proved to be crucial in confirming the wreck’s identity.\nThe US historian Michael Lowrey also provided the project team with a translated copy of notes extracted from an official German account and scans of U-27’s official war diary made by its commanding officer, Kapitänleutnant Bernd Wegener. These contained descriptions of the events leading up to the sinking, coordinates for the attack and the exact location on Hartdale where the torpedo struck its hull – a detail strikingly confirmed by the sonar scan data.\nArmed with this compelling evidence, the research team reached a definitive conclusion. The only viable candidate for the SS Hartdale was a previously “unknown” 105 metre long wreck. It has been lying just a few hundred metres to the south of where U-27 launched its fatal attack.\nUnrestricted submarine warfare\nFollowing its attack on Hartdale, the U-27 went on to play a prominent role in how naval warfare developed during the rest of the first world war. This came during a period of escalating tension in 1915.\nFollowing the sinking of the British ocean liners, RMS Lusitania in May, and the SS Arabic in August of that year by U-boats, the way the war at sea was being conducted became increasingly heated and controversial.\nShortly after the SS Arabic was sunk by a different U-boat, the U-27 was itself attacked and destroyed by the Royal Navy Q-ship HMS Baralong. Q-ships were heavily armed merchant ships designed to lure submarines into making surface attacks.\nThe surviving German sailors, including U-27’s commanding officer, were then allegedly executed by British sailors in front of American witnesses. It has since become known as the “Baralong incident”.\nGerman outcry over this event combined with other factors contributed to the start of “unrestricted submarine warfare” by Germany in February 1917. This meant that warnings were no longer issued to merchant vessels prior to U-boat attacks and loss of life was significantly increased.\nMichael Roberts, SEACAMS R&D Project Manager, Centre for Applied Marine Sciences, Bangor University. This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

But what of east Asia?</p>\n<h2>Cornerstone for Asian security</h2>\n<p>The security of east Asia – and thus the stability of the global economy – is predicated on a country we have yet to mention: Japan. The US-Japanese alliance has defined Asian security since the early days of the cold war and US troops have had a continuous presence on Japanese soil since 1945.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/us-japan-security-alliance\">1960 treaty</a> on which it is based, if Japan is attacked, the US must come to its defence. The obligation is not mutual, however, thanks to the pacifist clause US officials inserted into <a href=\"https://japan.kantei.go.jp/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html\">Japan’s postwar constitution</a>.</p>\n<p>The intention was to prevent Japan becoming a future threat, and the result is that Japan became an “unsinkable aircraft carrier”, with US military bases scattered across the archipelago.</p>\n<p>This “Pax Americana” enabled decades of regional peace and economic growth – albeit on terms dictated by the US. For decades, Japan was a sleeping partner in all this: enjoying the peace and prosperity without spending much on its own military or getting involved in US adventurism.</p>\n<p>But after years of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/01/11/japan-prime-minister-rearmament-china-north-korea/\">US pressure to remilitarise</a>, today Japan is <a href=\"https://news.usni.org/2023/12/22/japanese-cabinet-approves-largest-ever-defense-budget\">increasing military spending</a> and taking a regional leadership role. This is Japan’s response to a rising China, relative US decline, and increasingly isolationist American public opinion – not to mention Trump’s “America first” rhetoric.</p>\n<h2>‘Proactive Pacifism’</h2>\n<p>Today’s changes are the culmination of decades of drift from pacifism to “normality”. Following Shinzo Abe’s return to power in 2012, Japan rolled out a new security doctrine in the form of its <a href=\"https://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/ejcjs/vol18/iss3/envall.html\">“proactive pacifism”</a>.</p>\n<p>As part of this shift, in December 2022 Japan introduced a revised <a href=\"https://www.mod.go.jp/j/policy/agenda/guideline/pdf/security_strategy_en.pdf\">national security strategy</a> and new security institutions such as a <a href=\"https://www.mofa.go.jp/fp/nsp/page1we_000080.html\">National Security Council</a>. It has lifted a long-standing <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/22/japan-eases-curbs-on-weapons-exports-raises-defence-budget-to-record-56bn\">ban on arms exports</a>, initiated new <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/japans-role-advancing-networked-regional-security-architecture\">regional security partnerships</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/13/japans-pm-vows-to-modernise-military-for-new-era-of-threats\">modernised</a> its military, and reinterpreted the postwar pacifist constitution to allow for Japan’s participation in <a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/japans-evolving-position-use-force-collective-self-defense\">collective self-defence</a> operations alongside allies.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, Abe’s government crafted its <a href=\"https://www.asean.emb-japan.go.jp/files/000352880.pdf\">“Free and Open Indo-Pacific”</a> vision, thus engineering a new geopolitical space that has defined the parameters for rebalancing China’s rise.</p>\n<p>These changes were designed to increase Japan’s influence within the context of the US alliance. Then came Trump’s 2016 presidential election. The rhetoric of “America first” increased fears of abandonment in Tokyo. Given the alternative scenario – facing China alone – the Abe government worked hard to keep Trump onside, making trade and diplomatic concessions, and pledging to <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14799855.2020.1838486\">“make the alliance even greater”</a>.</p>\n<h2>After Ukraine</h2>\n<p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was the final nail in the coffin of Japan’s postwar pacifism. On the first anniversary of the invasion, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida <a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/02/25/japan/politics/japan-ukraine-anniversary-g7/\">warned,</a> “Ukraine today could be east Asia tomorrow,” implying that Taiwan could be next.</p>\n<p>Continuing where Abe left off, he pledged to increase military spending as well as lifting the remaining restrictions on arms exports, while <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01442872.2024.2309218\">strengthening Japan’s relations with Nato</a>.</p>\n<p>Increasing global instability has prompted Japan to abandon its low-profile, economy-first approach, seeking instead to shape regional and even global geopolitics. By expanding its security role, it has made itself even more indispensable to the US, which sees China as the primary long-term threat.</p>\n<p>So, while Japan may fear a second Trump presidency, the risk of abandonment is lower than that faced by America’s allies in Europe. Still, the long-term trend would appear to be that the US is pulling back and expecting its allies to do more. Meanwhile the instability of US politics in an election year means that nothing can be taken for granted.</p>\n<p>As the US recedes, can Japan fill the gap? Or will its ambitions exceed its capabilities? Already, plans to further develop its military are hampered by a shrinking economy and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/26/japan-population-how-many-people-drops-first-time-births-deaths\">shrinking population</a>. While China faces similar issues, its economy is over four times bigger than that of Japan’s, and its population is ten times the size.</p>\n<p>Thus, the only realistic way for Japan to balance China, manage North Korea, and maintain its regional position, is for the US to stay engaged. And even that might not be enough to prevent China from invading Taiwan. The future of the region, and of the global economy, hangs in the balance.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

It has lifted a long-standing ban on arms exports, initiated new regional security partnerships, modernised its military, and reinterpreted the postwar pacifist constitution to allow for Japan’s participation in collective self-defence operations alongside allies.\nMost importantly, Abe’s government crafted its “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” vision, thus engineering a new geopolitical space that has defined the parameters for rebalancing China’s rise.\nThese changes were designed to increase Japan’s influence within the context of the US alliance. Then came Trump’s 2016 presidential election. The rhetoric of “America first” increased fears of abandonment in Tokyo. Given the alternative scenario – facing China alone – the Abe government worked hard to keep Trump onside, making trade and diplomatic concessions, and pledging to “make the alliance even greater”.\nAfter Ukraine\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine was the final nail in the coffin of Japan’s postwar pacifism. On the first anniversary of the invasion, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida warned, “Ukraine today could be east Asia tomorrow,” implying that Taiwan could be next.\nContinuing where Abe left off, he pledged to increase military spending as well as lifting the remaining restrictions on arms exports, while strengthening Japan’s relations with Nato.\nIncreasing global instability has prompted Japan to abandon its low-profile, economy-first approach, seeking instead to shape regional and even global geopolitics. By expanding its security role, it has made itself even more indispensable to the US, which sees China as the primary long-term threat.\nSo, while Japan may fear a second Trump presidency, the risk of abandonment is lower than that faced by America’s allies in Europe. Still, the long-term trend would appear to be that the US is pulling back and expecting its allies to do more. Meanwhile the instability of US politics in an election year means that nothing can be taken for granted.\nAs the US recedes, can Japan fill the gap? Or will its ambitions exceed its capabilities? Already, plans to further develop its military are hampered by a shrinking economy and a shrinking population. While China faces similar issues, its economy is over four times bigger than that of Japan’s, and its population is ten times the size.\nThus, the only realistic way for Japan to balance China, manage North Korea, and maintain its regional position, is for the US to stay engaged. And even that might not be enough to prevent China from invading Taiwan. The future of the region, and of the global economy, hangs in the balance.\nPaul O’Shea, Senior Lecturer, Centre for East and South-East Asian Studies, Lund University and Sebastian Maslow, Senior Lecturer in International Relations, Sendai Shirayuri Women’s College. This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
