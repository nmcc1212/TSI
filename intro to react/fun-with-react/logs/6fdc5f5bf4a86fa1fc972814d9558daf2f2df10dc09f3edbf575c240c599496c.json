Searching individual users will reveal the servers that Spy Pet can track them across, a raw and exportable table of their messages, and connected accounts, such as GitHub.

But someone claims to be catching and compiling that data and is offering packages that can track more than 600 million users across more than 14,000 servers.\nJoseph Cox at 404 Media confirmed that Spy Pet, a service that sells access to a database of purportedly 3 billion Discord messages, offers data \"credits\" to customers who pay in bitcoin, ethereum, or other cryptocurrency. Searching individual users will reveal the servers that Spy Pet can track them across, a raw and exportable table of their messages, and connected accounts, such as GitHub. Ominously, Spy Pet lists more than 86,000 other servers in which it has \"no bots,\" but \"we know it exists.\"\n\nAs Cox notes, Discord doesn't make messages inside server channels, like blog posts or unlocked social media feeds, easy to publicly access and search.

You can see glimpses of this newer, less curse-laden approach in how Torvalds recently addressed a commit with which he vehemently disagreed. It involves tabs.\nThe commit last week changed exactly one thing on one line, replacing a tab character with a space: \"It helps Kconfig parsers to read file without error.\" Torvalds responded with a commit of his own, as spotted by The Register, which would \"add some hidden tabs on purpose.\" Trying to smooth over a tabs-versus-spaces matter seemed to awaken Torvalds to the need to have tab-detecting failures be \"more obvious.\" Torvalds would have added more, he wrote, but didn't \"want to make things uglier than necessary. But it *might* be necessary if it turns out we see more of this kind of silly tooling.\"\nIf you've read this far and don't understand what's happening, please allow me, a failed CS minor, to offer a quick explanation: Tabs Versus Spaces will never be truly resolved, codified, or set right by standards, and the energy spent on the issue over time could, if harnessed, likely power one or more small nations. Still, the Linux kernel has its own coding style, and it directly cites \"K&R,\" or Kernighan & Ritchie, the authors of the coding bible The C Programming Language, which is a tabs book. If you are submitting kernel code, it had better use tabs (eight-character tabs, ideally, though that is tied in part to teletype and line-printer history).\n\nRead 4 remaining paragraphs | Comments",
