    "content": "A new study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine finds that about 22 minutes a day of moderate to vigorous activity may combat the negative effects of prolonged sitting. Furthermore, they researchers found that as a person's activity level increases, the risk of dying prematurely from any cause goes down. NBC News reports: In the study, researchers looked at information from nearly 12,000 people ages 50 and older in four datasets from Norway, Sweden and the United States. In those datasets, the participants wore movement detection devices on their hips for 10 hours a day for at least four days. All of the individuals included in the new study were tracked for at least two years. In the new analysis, the researchers accounted for factors, including medical conditions, that could've affected risk of early death. About half of the participants spent 10 1/2 hours or more sedentary each day.\n \nWhen the researchers linked the participants' information with death registries in the different countries, they found that over an average of five years, 805 people, or 17%, had died. Of those who died, 357, or 6%, had spent less than 10 1/2 hours a day seated, while 448 averaged 10 1/2 hours or more sedentary. Sitting for more than 12 hours a day, the researchers found, was associated with a 38% increased risk of death as compared to eight hours, but only among those who managed to get less than 22 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity a day.\n \nThe risk of death went down with increasing amounts of physical activity. An extra 10 minutes a day translated into a 15% lower risk of death among those spending fewer than 10 1/2 hours seated and a 35% lower risk among those who spent more than 10 1/2 hours sedentary each day. Lower intensity activity only made a difference among participants who spent 12 or more hours sitting every day. The study's lead author, Edvard Sagelv, a researcher at The Arctic University of Norway, broke the findings down into manageable terms. \"Think of it: only 20 minutes of this a day is enough, meaning, a small stroll of 10 minutes twice a day -- like jumping off the bus one stop before your actual destination to work and then when taking the bus back home, jumping off one stop before.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Around+20+Minutes+of+Exercise+a+Day+May+Balance+Out+the+Harms+of+Sitting%2C+Study+Finds%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F23%2F10%2F27%2F0024211%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F23%2F10%2F27%2F0024211%2Faround-20-minutes-of-exercise-a-day-may-balance-out-the-harms-of-sitting-study-finds%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://science.slashdot.org/story/23/10/27/0024211/around-20-minutes-of-exercise-a-day-may-balance-out-the-harms-of-sitting-study-finds?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23109607&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

The Guardian reports: In the study, 24 pigeons were given a variety of visual tasks, some of which they learned to categorize in a matter of days, and others in a matter of weeks. The researchers found evidence that the mechanism that pigeons used to make correct choices is similar to the method that AI models use to make the right predictions. \"Pigeon behavior suggests that nature has created an algorithm that is highly effective in learning very challenging tasks,\" said Edward Wasserman, study co-author and professor of experimental psychology at the University of Iowa. \"Not necessarily with the greatest speed, but with great consistency.\"\n \nOn a screen, pigeons were shown different stimuli, like lines of different width, placement and orientation, as well as sectioned and concentric rings. Each bird had to peck a button on the right or left to decide which category they belonged to. If they got it correct, they got food, in the form of a pellet; if they got it wrong, they got nothing. \"Pigeons don't need a rule,\" said Brandon Turner, lead author of the study and professor of psychology at Ohio State University. Instead they learn through trial and error. For example, when they were given a visual, say \"category A\", anything that looked close to that they also classified as \"category A\", tapping into their ability to identify similarities.\n \nOver the course of the experiments, pigeons improved their ability to make right choices from 55% to 95% of the time when it came to some of the simpler tasks. Presented with a more complex challenge, their accuracy went up from 55% to 68%. In an AI model, the main goal is to recognize patterns and make decisions. Pigeons, as research shows, can do the same. Learning from consequences, when not given a food pellet, pigeons have a remarkable ability to correct their errors. Similarity function is also at play for pigeons, by using their ability to find resemblance between two objects. \"With just those two mechanisms alone, you can define a neural network or an artificial intelligent machine to basically solve these categorization problems,\" said Turner. \"It stands to reason that the mechanisms that are present in the AI are also present in the pigeon.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Pigeons+Problem-Solve+Similarly+To+Artificial+Intelligence%2C+Research+Shows%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F23%2F10%2F27%2F003230%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F23%2F10%2F27%2F003230%2Fpigeons-problem-solve-similarly-to-artificial-intelligence-research-shows%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://science.slashdot.org/story/23/10/27/003230/pigeons-problem-solve-similarly-to-artificial-intelligence-research-shows?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23109591&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

    "content": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Sam Bankman-Fried took the stand in his criminal trial today in an attempt to avoid decades in prison for alleged fraud at cryptocurrency exchange FTX and its affiliate Alameda Research. [...] Some of the alleged fraud relates to how Alameda borrowed money from FTX. In testimony today, \"Bankman-Fried said he believed that under FTX's terms of service, sister firm Alameda was allowed in many circumstances to borrow funds from the exchange,\" the WSJ wrote. Bankman-Fried reportedly said the terms of service were written by FTX lawyers and that he only \"skimmed\" certain parts. \"I read parts in depth. Parts I skimmed over,\" Bankman-Fried reportedly said after [U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan] asked if he read the entire terms of service document.\n \nSassoon asked Bankman-Fried if he had \"any conversations with lawyers about Alameda spending customer money that was deposited into FTX bank accounts,\" according to Bloomberg's live coverage. \"I don't recall any conversations that were contemporaneous and phrased that way,\" Bankman-Fried answered. \"I had so many conversations with lawyers later when we were trying to reconcile things in November 2022,\" Bankman-Fried also said. \"There were conversations around Alameda being used as a payment processor, a payment agent for FTX. I frankly don't recall conversations with lawyers or otherwise about the usage of the funds or the North Dimension accounts.\" North Dimension was an Alameda subsidiary.

    "contentSnippet": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Sam Bankman-Fried took the stand in his criminal trial today in an attempt to avoid decades in prison for alleged fraud at cryptocurrency exchange FTX and its affiliate Alameda Research. [...] Some of the alleged fraud relates to how Alameda borrowed money from FTX. In testimony today, \"Bankman-Fried said he believed that under FTX's terms of service, sister firm Alameda was allowed in many circumstances to borrow funds from the exchange,\" the WSJ wrote. Bankman-Fried reportedly said the terms of service were written by FTX lawyers and that he only \"skimmed\" certain parts. \"I read parts in depth. Parts I skimmed over,\" Bankman-Fried reportedly said after [U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan] asked if he read the entire terms of service document.\n \nSassoon asked Bankman-Fried if he had \"any conversations with lawyers about Alameda spending customer money that was deposited into FTX bank accounts,\" according to Bloomberg's live coverage. \"I don't recall any conversations that were contemporaneous and phrased that way,\" Bankman-Fried answered. \"I had so many conversations with lawyers later when we were trying to reconcile things in November 2022,\" Bankman-Fried also said. \"There were conversations around Alameda being used as a payment processor, a payment agent for FTX. I frankly don't recall conversations with lawyers or otherwise about the usage of the funds or the North Dimension accounts.\" North Dimension was an Alameda subsidiary. The Securities and Exchange Commission has alleged that \"Bankman-Fried directed FTX to have customers send funds to North Dimension in an effort to hide the fact that the funds were being sent to an account controlled by Alameda.\" [...]\n \nIn an overview of the alleged crimes, the indictment said Bankman-Fried \"misappropriated and embezzled FTX customer deposits and used billions of dollars in stolen funds... to enrich himself; to support the operations of FTX; to fund speculative venture investments; to help fund over a hundred million dollars in campaign contributions to Democrats and Republicans to seek to influence cryptocurrency regulation; and to pay for Alameda's operating costs.\" He was also accused of making \"false and fraudulent statements and representations to FTX's investors and Alameda's lenders.\" SBF's legal team decided that he would take the stand in his own defense -- a risky decision by legal observers as he will have to face cross-examination from federal prosecutors.

On Wednesday, the world learned that the feature has never worked as advertised. Despite promises that this never-changing address would be hidden and replaced with a private one that was unique to each SSID, Apple devices have continued to display the real one, which in turn got broadcast to every other connected device on the network. [...]\n \nIn 2020, Apple released iOS 14 with a feature that, by default, hid Wi-Fi MACs when devices connected to a network. Instead, the device displayed what Apple called a \"private Wi-Fi address\" that was different for each SSID. Over time, Apple has enhanced the feature, for instance, by allowing users to assign a new private Wi-Fi address for a given SSID. On Wednesday, Apple released iOS 17.1. Among the various fixes was a patch for a vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-42846, which prevented the privacy feature from working. Tommy Mysk, one of the two security researchers Apple credited with discovering and reporting the vulnerability (Talal Haj Bakry was the other), told Ars that he tested all recent iOS releases and found the flaw dates back to version 14, released in September 2020. \"From the get-go, this feature was useless because of this bug,\" he said. \"We couldn't stop the devices from sending these discovery requests, even with a VPN.

The \"source\" listed in the request was the private Wi-Fi address. Digging in a little further, however, it became clear that the real, permanent MAC was still broadcast to all other connected devices, just in a different field of the request.

    "content": "\"Threads is officially a success,\" writes long-time Slashdot reader destinyland. 9to5Mac reports: During Meta's quarterly earnings call today, CEO Mark Zuckerberg offered an update on the Threads, saying that the service has \"just under\" 100 million monthly active users. When Threads launched in July, the app quickly rocketed to having 100 million users within just a few days. While that growth is believed to have slowed down, as expected when something takes off so quickly, Zuckerberg says the service is currently at almost 100 million active users. Note the difference in terms, too.

    "contentSnippet": "\"Threads is officially a success,\" writes long-time Slashdot reader destinyland. 9to5Mac reports: During Meta's quarterly earnings call today, CEO Mark Zuckerberg offered an update on the Threads, saying that the service has \"just under\" 100 million monthly active users. When Threads launched in July, the app quickly rocketed to having 100 million users within just a few days. While that growth is believed to have slowed down, as expected when something takes off so quickly, Zuckerberg says the service is currently at almost 100 million active users. Note the difference in terms, too. Having 100 million \"users\" is one thing, while having 100 million monthly active users is quite different -- and more impressive.\n \nThe number is also impressive when you consider that Threads isn't available to the millions of people who live in the European Union. As noted by The Verge, Zuckerberg also reiterated today that Meta's goal is to turn Threads into a \"billion-person public conversations app\" that is \"a bit more positive\" than some of the competition.

    "content": "Google Fiber plans to upgrade some users to 20Gbps service by the end of the year. Ars Technica reports: Google's Wednesday blog post calls this part of a \"GFiber Labs\" experiment and says the service \"will initially be available as an early access offering to a small group of GFiber customers in select areas.\" The 20Gbps service is made possible by new networking gear: Nokia's 25G PON (passive optical network) technology, which lets Internet service providers push more bandwidth over existing fiber lines. Google says it's \"one of the first\" ISPs to adopt the technology for consumers, though at least one other US ISP, the Tennessee provider \"EPB,\" has rolled out the technology. Customers will need new networking gear, too, and Google says you'll get a new fiber modem with built-in Wi-Fi 7.\n \nFierce Telecom spoke with Google's Nick Saporito, head of product at Google Fiber, who said, \"We definitely see a need\" for 20Gbps service.

    "contentSnippet": "Google Fiber plans to upgrade some users to 20Gbps service by the end of the year. Ars Technica reports: Google's Wednesday blog post calls this part of a \"GFiber Labs\" experiment and says the service \"will initially be available as an early access offering to a small group of GFiber customers in select areas.\" The 20Gbps service is made possible by new networking gear: Nokia's 25G PON (passive optical network) technology, which lets Internet service providers push more bandwidth over existing fiber lines. Google says it's \"one of the first\" ISPs to adopt the technology for consumers, though at least one other US ISP, the Tennessee provider \"EPB,\" has rolled out the technology. Customers will need new networking gear, too, and Google says you'll get a new fiber modem with built-in Wi-Fi 7.\n \nFierce Telecom spoke with Google's Nick Saporito, head of product at Google Fiber, who said, \"We definitely see a need\" for 20Gbps service. For now, Saporito says the service is \"a very early adopter product,\" but it will eventually roll out \"in most, if not all, of our markets.\" According to that Fierce report, Fiber is built on Nokia's \"Quillion\" Fiber platform, which is upgradable, so Google only needed to \"plug in a new optical module and replace the optical network terminal on the end-user side\" to take its 5 and 8Gbps infrastructure to 20Gbps.\n \nThere's no word yet on the price or which utopian Google Fiber cities will get access to the 20Gbps service, but Google has already run trials in Kansas City, Missouri.

Regulation is critical to safe innovation, so that a handful of AI corporations don't jeopardize our shared future.\"\n \nIn a policy document published this week, 23 AI experts, including two modern \"godfathers\" of the technology, said governments must be allowed to halt development of exceptionally powerful models. Gillian Hadfield, a co-author of the paper and the director of the Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society at the University of Toronto, said AI models were being built over the next 18 months that would be many times more powerful than those already in operation. \"There are companies planning to train models with 100x more computation than today's state of the art, within 18 months,\" she said. \"No one knows how powerful they will be. And there's essentially no regulation on what they'll be able to do with these models.\"\n \nThe paper, whose authors include Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio -- two winners of the ACM Turing award, the \"Nobel prize for computing\" -- argues that powerful models must be licensed by governments and, if necessary, have their development halted. \"For exceptionally capable future models, eg models that could circumvent human control, governments must be prepared to license their development, pause development in response to worrying capabilities, mandate access controls, and require information security measures robust to state-level hackers, until adequate protections are ready.\" The unrestrained development of artificial general intelligence, the term for a system that can carry out a wide range of tasks at or above human levels of intelligence, is a key concern among those calling for tighter regulation.

From a report: At a hearing in December, a legal representative for the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) is expected to argue against the publication of documents that contain details about the risk of pollution as a result of decommissioning the Brent oilfield, which was operated by Shell for more than 40 years. It says it opposes publication \"on a matter of process basis.\" Shell has applied for an exemption from international rules that require all infrastructure to be removed from the field and the UK government is deciding whether it will allow the oil company to leave the 170-metre-high oil platform legs in place for the three platforms known as Bravo, Charlie and Delta. \n\nA total of 64 concrete storage cells are contained in the leg structures, 42 of which have previously been used for oil storage and separation. Most of the cells are the size of seven Olympic swimming pools, and collectively still contain an estimated 72,000 tonnes of contaminated sediment and 638,000 cubic metres of oily water. Environmental groups believe the documents held by the NSTA would reveal new information about long-term environmental dangers that is relevant to other North Sea oil developments, including Equinor's plans to develop Rosebank, the UK's largest untapped field.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=+UK+Regulator+Trying+To+Block+Release+of+Shell+North+Sea+Documents%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F23%2F10%2F26%2F1933203%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F23%2F10%2F26%2F1933203%2Fuk-regulator-trying-to-block-release-of-shell-north-sea-documents%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/23/10/26/1933203/uk-regulator-trying-to-block-release-of-shell-north-sea-documents?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23109343&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

Now, a new report highlights some of the internal divisions over the \"rushed-out\" policy introduction and provides new insight into what may have been motivating the company to even attempt such a plan.\nBusiness-focused site MobileGamer.biz cites multiple \"sources from inside Unity and across the mobile games business\" in reporting that Unity received some significant pushback from senior-level managers before rolling out its initial fee-restructuring plans. \"Half of the people in that meeting said that this model is too complicated, it’s not going to be well-received, and we should talk to people before we do this,\" one anonymous source told the site. \"It felt very rushed. We had this meeting and were told it was happening, but we were not told a date. And then before we knew it, it was out there.\"\nAfter the negative reaction to that initial plan, Unity reportedly considered a modification that would take up to 4 percent of revenue from the largest Unity publishers—slightly under the 5 percent charged by the Unreal Engine. The final policy knocked that cap down to 2.5 percent only after the extent of the backlash became clear.\n\nRead 6 remaining paragraphs | Comments",
